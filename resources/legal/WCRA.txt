The Worker and Consumer Rights Agreement of Black Espresso (WCRA) - Last updated Mon, Feb 10th, 2025. 3:28 PM EST.

Worker and consumer needs are a top priority. 

In this agreement, Black Espresso believes and agrees with all of our workers and consumers to respect all of their following conditions, rights, and etc.

However, both workers and consumers are also responsible for having basic common sense, and agree that while they may have protected rights and conditions, they cannot violate specific conditions themselves in order to protect the rights and safety of others.

All workers are required to have the right to:

- All first amendment rights from the United States of America's Bill of Rights, with the exception that NO inappropriate (disrepectful, NSFW, slur-y, or arguably directly mean/harmful) language for the intent of hurting others or being immature shall be respected in office. Swearing is allowed, but at a minimum (essentially just don't constanly swear and be distracting or problematic).
- Fair, respectful treatment regardless of whatever they may look like, believe in, etc. Generally, we judge in terms of merit only.
- To strike and speak against Black Espresso for any valid violation of their required needs and rights.
- Request breaks and reasonable accommodations if necessary.
- All members of Black Espresso must all equally receive FAIR payment, that may vary based on their specific job or role.
- To ask for a raise when necessary and if possible.
- No AI/machine learning is allowed to be used whatsoever against workers (such as straight up replacing any worker with AI or the general use of generative AI).
- Remote working must be an option, especially to those who cannot work at Black Espresso in person. The only exception is if a worker specifically is in any way in a management or high-r esponsibility role.

All consumers are promised and must be promised with:

- No anti-consumer practices (as much as possible).
- We must respect the consumers' rights and they themselves, regardless of whatever they may look like, believe in, what they find attractive or are attracted to, their privacy, etc.
- We must treat all people fairly and acknowledge that they are people.
- We cannot deny service to absolutely anyone just because of what they may look like, believe in, what they find attractive or are attracted to, etc.
- If consumers themselves treat our own workers unfairly (such as being mean or disrespectful towards them for unfair reasons) is when we are allowed to deny service.
- Workers cannot be disrespectful or mean towards people who are receiving service from Black Espresso.
- If we are ever responsible for any failure, it is the duty of workers or consumers to give valid criticism, and it is our duty to listen, learn, and improve, as Black Espresso may end up failing sometimes. It is impossible to always be perfect. But it is possible that we continue to learn, grow, and improve the best we can.
- We (Black Espresso) must always focus on delivering quality the best we can, and we cannot rush or mistreat our workers.
- AI can not be used in any of our productions. Any use of generative AI/machine learning would violate the rights and needs of our workers and generally would degrade the quality of our productions.
